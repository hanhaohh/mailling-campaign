Mailing marketing offers can be costly.  We want to send out solicitations for donations; each solicitation costs us $0.68.  we will analyze three algorithms for these data: tree induction, logistic regression.  our ultimate goal is to build the ‘best’ model given the mailing_hw3 data and then use it to target new prospects from the “Use” data based on our analysis.

Note: Since we do not know the label in the “Use” data, it is currently showing 0 for all examples – but understand that the 0 is just a placeholder, not the truth. You have a budget of $5000, and you will decide how to spend that on targeting.

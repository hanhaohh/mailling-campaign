Mailing marketing offers can be costly.  We want to send out solicitations for donations; each solicitation costs us $0.68.  Under NYU Classes->Resources->Data->Homework 3 Mailing you will find a pair of data files from our problem in the correct format for Python as .csv (required for MSDS, optional for MBA,MSIS) and Weka as .arff (MBA,MSIS).  The files are mailing_hw3 and mailing_hw3_use.  You will analyze (at least) three algorithms for these data: tree induction, logistic regression, and any other method of your choice.  Your ultimate goal is to build the ‘best’ model given the mailing_hw3 data and then use it to target new prospects from the “Use” data based on your analysis. Since you do not know the label in the “Use” data, it is currently showing 0 for all examples – but understand that the 0 is just a placeholder, not the truth. You have a budget of $5000, and you will decide how to spend that on targeting.
